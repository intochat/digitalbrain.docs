# ClickHouse

## Connections and deployment credentials

The module's ConnectorDefinition declares supported authentication methods and Integration
dependencies. Platform delivers credentials through scoped async Integration handles; credential
values never belong in module options. User authorizations are per-brain connection neurons holding
sealed credentials. The offered connector catalog is `GET /connectors`, and user connections are managed
at `/brains/{id}/connections`. Provision deployment credentials with
`DigitalBrain:Integrations:{id}:{Field}`; ordinary options stay under `DigitalBrain:Modules:{id}:Options`.

Integrations are what the deployment provisions; Connections are what users authorize.

Own-infrastructure ClickHouse access uses Integration `clickhouse` with required secret
`ConnectionString`. Driver and behavior options contain no connection credential. Provider
initialization awaits the scoped handle after Platform has seeded Integrations.
